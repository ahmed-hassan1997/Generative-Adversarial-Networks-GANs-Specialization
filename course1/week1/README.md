###  In this notebook, you're going to create your first generative adversarial network (GAN) for this course! Specifically, 

### you will build and train a GAN that can generate hand-written images of digits (0-9). You will be using PyTorch in this specialization,

### so if you're not familiar with this framework, you may find the PyTorch documentation useful. The hints will also often include links to relevant documentation.
